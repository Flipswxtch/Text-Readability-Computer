The Flesch-Kincaid Formula is used to determine the grade-based reading comprehension level that is required to read a given text. More information can be found about the formula on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests.

The number of words, sentences, and syllables in the text are used to calculate the readability score. This score is then translated into a grade level. The output of this module prints the number of words, sentences, syllables, reading score, and the grade level to standard output.

To clarify the files located in this repository:
analyze.py is the main program.
ch1text.py contains the text that is being used in the main program. 
kevin_compute.py is importing the analyze module and passing its own text to be analyzed.
